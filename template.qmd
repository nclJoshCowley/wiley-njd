      Document serves as example input for Quarto template openly available
        from Github, see more information at
        <https://github.com/nclJoshCowley/wiley-njd>.
      All rendering requires LaTeX to be installed, this includes any 
        TeX installation bundled with Quarto.
      Since Wiley's "New Journal Design" (NJD) LaTeX template is utilised in
        the build process, usage is subject to any license associated with
        original template.

# Example Content

## Equations

As with LaTeX, we can create in-line equations with $y = mx + c$ and create
  display single-line equations with

$$
    a^n
        = b^n + c^n
$$

For multi-line equations, use the `$$` around a `begin{aligned}[t]` method.

$$
\begin{aligned}[t]
    y_1
        &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1
    \\
        &\vdots
    \\
    y_n
        &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_n
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-linreg}


## Code

In-line code can be enacted with backticks, for example $1 + 1 = `r 1 + 1`$.

Display code chunks are formulated in the usual Quarto way.

```{r}
factorial(5)
```

For example, output is suppressed via the chunk option `#| echo: false`.

```{r}
#| echo: false
sprintf("10! = %i", factorial(10))
```


## Images

We can include graphics that already exist with

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://quarto.org/quarto.png")
```

And we can generate our own plots using R code

```{r}
#| label: fig-cars
#| fig-cap: "A scatter plot of weight and MPG from the `mtcars` dataset"
#| echo: false
mtcars |> 
  ggplot2::ggplot(ggplot2::aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
  ggplot2::geom_point() +
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, colour = "red") +
  ggplot2::labs(
    title = "Negative Correlation between Weight and MPG",
    y = "Weight",
    x = "Mile per Gallon (MPG)"
  )
```


## Cross-Reference

We want to be able to reference already defined items such as

1. linear regression, as described in (@eq-linreg).

1. scatter plot of `mtcars` data, @fig-cars.


## Citations

We can cite is a few different ways that are consistent with `natbib`

1. Parenthesised citation, using a `citep` equivalent [@Hirt1974].

1. Textual citation, using a `citet` equivalent like @Hirt1974.

Multiple citations follow usual Quarto syntax and are split by a semi-colon
  [@Hirt1974; @Benson1992; @Dukowicz1984].


## Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they belong to the previous
    footnote.

    Multi-paragraph footnotes work like multi-paragraph list items.
